# For now, can be empty to simply mark the directory as a package.
# If you needed to import the app object from elsewhere (e.g., for advanced testing setups
# or if mounting this app within another FastAPI app), you could expose it:
# from .main import app

# Defining __all__ is good practice if you intend for `from nlp_content_agent import *`
# to import specific things, though direct imports are usually preferred.
# __all__ = ["app"] # Example if app was imported above
