httpx>=0.23.0,<0.28.0 # For making API calls to third-party services and Django
python-dotenv>=0.20.0,<2.0.0 # For managing environment variables locally

# Add any libraries needed by the actual clients for:
# - LLM (e.g., google-cloud-aiplatform)
# - TTS (e.g., google-cloud-texttospeech)
# - The chosen Third-Party Avatar Video Generation Service (if they have a Python SDK)
# - Google Cloud Storage (e.g., google-cloud-storage)

# For now, keeping it minimal as we are mocking heavily.
# Example if using Google Cloud client libraries (uncomment when ready):
# google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.20.0
# google-cloud-texttospeech>=2.10.0
# google-cloud-storage>=2.0.0
